        <h3>Project Motivation:</h3>
        <p>
            In principle, an organized religion gives its followers a set of rules that they must follow. A framework for understanding life is written in the church's doctrine, and the central stories of that religion are usually interpreted by clergy in worship services. 
            In reality, however, the individuals who follow the religion reshape it by practicing it in their own unique ways. A religion is nothing without its followers, and a study of a particular religion should acknowledge the role that it plays in the life of its followers.
            Religion provides a sense of comfort, community, and connection to its followers (among other things), and these elements are perhaps more integral to a religion than its written principles. </p>
            
            <p>This interpretation of organized religion informs my project. I will analyze Barbara Sostaita's "Water not Walls" with the goal of 
                showing that religious objects or rituals are not always strictly tied to the church. Instead, any object or practice that provides comfort, builds a sense of community, or enhances the connections between people can be considered sacred.

        <p>Also, check out the <a href="/finalproject/quiz">Quiz</a> tab, I made a quiz to test your geography knowledge of the borderlands. It's not uniquely tied to the rest of my project, but it does feature several locations that we talked about in class.</p>
